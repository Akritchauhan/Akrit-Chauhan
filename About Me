💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Akrit Chauhan 👋

I’m a B.Tech ECE student passionate about Digital Design, FPGA development, and RTL engineering.
I enjoy turning hardware ideas into real-time systems and exploring new technologies in Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL, and Python.

Currently, I work on projects like Smart Health Monitoring Systems and FPGA-based controllers, and I love sharing my learning journey and open-source contributions.

I aim to grow as a Digital Design Engineer, building innovative hardware solutions and improving my skills in digital design, verification, and embedded systems.
